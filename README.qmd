## Goal

Create an End to End machine learning pipeline to classify physics paper abstracts into broad categories
and deploy the model for anyone to test.
The baseline model is logistic regression, additionally using SVM, and BERT.
Currently the logistic regression model is being hosted on [Render](https://arxiv-classifier.onrender.com/).
Please give the app a minute to wake up if it has gone to sleep.
